#PLEASE NOTE:
if there are any issues with running this in the way described in run.txt,</br>
you can compile it with "cargo build --release" which will create an executable </br>
at "./targert/release/wombat" </br>
This will allow you to move this executable to any desired location and run with:</br>
"./wombat" or "./wombat.exe"

In addition, the code will live here if anything is missing: [https://github.com/sparks5115/UltimateTicTacToeAI/tree/optimized-submission](https://github.com/sparks5115/UltimateTicTacToeAI/tree/optimized-submission)
